              <b>Project Type: </b> Individual<br>
              <b>Role: </b>Developer<br>
              <b>Project Description: </b> Task was to develop an application which simulated an animated and moving
              company logo when the "application" is not being used; to behave like a screen saver. This solution was designed to work  on a Windows based PC.<br>
              <b>Code Description: </b> This application was written using C++ in Visual Studios using win32 libraries for GLFW, OpenGL, GLEW, SOIL. I designed it to be a 2d animation ion an orthographic view, and used 8 png files (animation frames).
              
              The code was developed with the following assumptions:
              <ul class="project-res">
                <li>Assumed a minimum window size would be 800x600, it has been designed to be resized to larger dimensions.</li>
                <li>Assumed anywhere beyond the edges of the screen, meant just sitting anywhere on the outside border, e.g.
                  <ul class="sub-project-res">
                    <li>x not being less than the -size.x of the logo width or x being greater than window width</li>
                    <li>y not being less than the -size.y of the logo height or y being greater than window height</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Following the above assumption, I assumed the position would be randomly generated, given these constraints.</li>
                <li>Assumed entry direction would be fixed given its starting location. e.g
                  <ul class="sub-project-res">
                    <li>NW quadrant - south-east direction</li>
                    <li>SW quadrant - north-east direction</li>
                    <li>NE quadrant - south-west direction</li>
                    <li>SE quadrant - north-west direction</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Assumed the demo would need the option to exit the animation, this has been implemented; 
                  <ul class="sub-project-res">
                    <li>the user can press "P" to cancel the animation </li>
                    <li>the user can press "R" to restart it </li>
                    <li>the user can press "Esc" to terminate the application. </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <b>Role: </b>Developer<br>
              <b>Project Description: </b>The primary focus of this project is how best to use interactive software/hardware in order to enhance/improve the virtual world experience for the user/s in order to help elicit declarative knowledge from an expert.<br>
              <b>Code Description: </b> The virtual world application was built using the Unity 5 development tool, the Unity provided assets, and obtained reef mesh data. The functionality of each application was primarily developed using the Unity C# scripting and libraries. 

              The application has been developed to allow for exploration of the virtual world, and the ability to act upon the virtual world via having the ability to select areas onto which information can be elicited. The majority of this functionality is achieved via the use of ray casting, which is used in order to detect possible collisions in a specified direction. For the purpose of these applications, it was designed that the rays were cast from the center of the user eye-line, with the purpose of indicating if they are "looking" at an intractable object. As such every item in the virtual environment has been outfitted with colliders and specific tags, in order to identify the type of object, the cast collides with. <br><br>

              The desktop application primarily was developed using the standard packages and libraries that are either inbuilt into the Unity 5 engine, or offered for free on the Unity Asset store. It was developed to use standard input from an attached keyboard and mouse setup, with a simple array of commands mapped to key application functionality. Basic movement was mapped to the standard directional keys and wasd setup, camera movement controlled via the mouse, and Interaction controls was limited to left-button mouse clicks for confirmation and interaction, Left-shift for rescaling in a elicitation state, and Left-ctrl for repositioning in a elicitation state. These controls chosen as they are simple to use, and should be familiar to most type of users, as they are fairly coming in HCI. <br><br>

              There are roughly 4 different main states of operation, Exploration state, Elicitation state, Inspection State, and a Exit State, with each having several sub-state. A diagram can be found in the gallery below. <br>

              <ul class="project-res">

                <li>The exploration state is the default state the application starts in, and will return to when the other states in the applications have ended. This state is designed to be responsible for handling the movement and object interaction controls and functionality developed for the application.</li>

                <li>The elicitation state occurs when the user has selected to interact with a Reef object in the virtual world. In this state the user can refine their selected area via entering one of the sub-states, reposition or rescaling. </li>

                <li>The inspection state occurs when the user has selected to interact with a Inspect Element object in the virtual world. In this state a HUD appears with details of the selected elements. In this state the user can enter the Edit sub-state in order to add to or edit previous stored expert information. </li>
                

                <li>Finally, the Exit Menu occurs when the playerhas hit escape in the exploration state, and is designed to handle the Saving and Loading of elicited information in addition to the Exiting the application. <br><br>
              </ul>

              <b>Project Type: </b>Individual <br>
              <b>Role: </b>Developer <br>
              <b>Project Description: </b>The primary focus of this project is how best to use interactive software/hardware in order to enhance/improve the virtual world experience for the user/s in order to help elicit declarative knowledge from an expert. <br>

              The application has been developed to allow for exploration of the virtual world, and the ability to act upon the virtual world via having the ability to select areas onto which information can be elicited. The majority of this functionality is achieved via the use of ray casting, which is used in order to detect possible collisions in a specified direction. For the purpose of these applications, it was designed that the rays were cast from the center of the user eye-line, with the purpose of indicating if they are "looking" at an intractable object. As such every item in the virtual environment has been outfitted with colliders and specific tags, in order to identify the type of object, the cast collides with. <br><br>

              The immersive application was designed to use the desktop version as a basis on which to build off of. However the UI and control system had to be re-purpose to work in an immersive VR setup. As such it was developed to use an Oculus[19] and Leap Motion Controller libraries and packages specifically developed to integrate with Unity 5. Using the LeapMotion API, the application was developed to work with four recognised gestures, as seen in the gesture figure found in the gallery below. The gesture A is used for movement in virtual world, B is used for indicating an interaction or for repositioning in the elicitation state, C is used for the rescaling of the elicitation area, and D is used for confirmation for elicitation areas.<br><br>

              As it is using VR technology, the UI system had to be converted to world space in order to allow for the user to interact with it correctly. This was then built upon by implementing the Hover VR Interface built for the LeapMotion controller, in order to give the user access to in world options, at literately the tips of their fingers. 
              <br><br>

              There are roughly 4 different main states of operation, Exploration state, Elicitation state, Inspection State, and a Exit State, with each having several sub-state. A diagram can be found in the gallery below. <br>

              <ul class="project-res" >

              <b>Role: </b>Ground Control Station and Localisation Developer <br>
              <b>Project Description: </b>Develop a UAV system to successfully navigate in an indoor environment, and locate potential pests (Gypsie Moths, Straw).<br>
              <b>Code Description: </b> For this project, I worked on two different systems that interacted with one another and several other subsystems, a Ground Control Station application and a Localisation system which could localise an UAV in an indoor environment. 

              Using C# I developed off a pre-existing Ground Control Application called Mission Planner, and built in additional user functionality that would integrate and work with an Image Processing subsystem that was also being developed. This add-on would notify the user if a pest had been found via the Image Processing background application. This was achieved via the use of background workers (threads) parsing a shared repository for images with pests detected in them. 

              If a new image with a pest has been found the application add-on uses information from the image files naming convention to notify the user by vocalising the type, updating the current pest image display with the found pest, adding the new image to a collection of other images found, and finally the map Mission Planner uses is updated to show exactly where in the silo the pest has been detected. 

              <br><br>

              As part of a team I helped developed an system, using C++ and the Arduino programming language, that could interface with a Vicon (Motion capture) system, an Autopilot and Telecommunications system, and the Ground Control Station in order to localise itself to the area in which it was flying. An application I primarily worked on was developed to work with a series of Arduinos, one on the ground and one attached to the UAV itself. I designed and developed the application to be able to connect to a Vicon server  and an attached serial device (an Arduino) and then periodically query the server for current locational data being generated by the UAV via the use of marker balls and Vicon IR cameras. From here the data is converted to Mavlink messages (a form of telecommunication protocols used by PIXHAWK autopilots for UAVs), and via the use of a serial connection the application sends these messages to the Arduino  on the ground which has an serial radio plugged into it. From this point the messages are then broadcasted to another radio attached to the UAV, which is plugged into the other Arduino. 

              This Arduino is programmed to act like an GPS system and communicate with the autopilot subsystem through its GPS port. It is designed to listen to the radio for that particular message being broadcast by ground control, and once detected process it and turn it into "fake" GPS messages using UBX protocol. These messages are then sent to the autopilots GPS port. Videos and imagery of this project can be found below.

              <b>Role: </b>Developer<br>
              <b>Project Description: </b>Build and design server and client applications that inteface with one another, in order to pass food calorie information. With the Server developed to behave as a database with food calorie information, with the Client developed as a means to access said information from the server. <br>
              <b>Code Description: </b>Two different applications have been developed, one a server which houses the food calorie database, and the other to act as a client for the server. The client application is designed to allow the user to query the server for food calorie information via sending a search term, and/or add a new item to the database used by the server. The server applicated is designed to accept and process a maximum of 10 incoming clients requests and handle them separately. If a search has been requested the server will look for items matching the search term and return an n number of found results to the client. If a new item is to be added the server will correctly place the new item in the correct alphabetic location and then save the database.<br><br>

              As part of this project I worked on developed the functionality to account for multiple clients connected to the server via the use of a thread pool, in addition to the functionality to allow for the client to add to the database. I also worked on the implementation of protective measures, such as semaphores and mutexes in order to protect and remove the risk of currupting data.<br><br>

              <b>Role: </b>Developer<br>
              <b>Project Description: </b>Build and design a program to simulate a one runway airport, that has planes arriving and departing on random intervals.<br>
              <b>Code Description: </b> The application is designed to have three different processes running at all times. A "producer" (process to create arriving airplanes), a "consumer" (process to destroy/depart airplanes), and a "observer" to allow the user to view current airport information (current capacity and airplane information) and/or exit the application. In addition to this there was a limit to airport capacity (10 at any time), and one runway which could only produce/consume one airplane at a time. I was in charge of the development of functionality to implement the "producer" in order to create and simulate incoming aircraft. Airplanes are randomly created/destroyed via the use of initial percentage values (inputted by the user at runtime) to determine the chances of an incoming/departing flight. If an airplane is to be created it checks the current capacity of the airport and then waits for the runway to be clear. From here a "new" airplane is created with a code that is randomly generated and then put into an empty flight bay randomly determined. <br><br>
              In addition to this I was also in charge of implementation of protective measures, such as semaphores and mutexes in order to protect shared data and remove the risk of corrupting it. They were also used as a mean to block the production/consumption of airplanes once the capacity had reached its limits.<br><br>

              <b>Project Description: </b>Design and implement a series of functions that encrypt/decrypt files, via the use of a Hadamard matrix.<br>
              <b>Code Description: </b>I was tasked to write this console application, and design it to have several different options built into it, which is chosen by the user at run time, and is designed to primarily work with PGM and txt files. As it is a console application, it requires the user to input some initial data: hadamard [option] <file 1> <file 2> {format u v depth}, format refering to PGM, u and v image size, and depth max pixel intensity. The options include:
              <ul class="project-res" >
                <li>e which will encrypt the file 1 into file 2 using u and v.</li>
                <li>d decrypt file 1 and place in file 2 using format u, v and depth</li>
                <li>p pack encoded data from file 1 into file 2</li>
                <li>u unpack encoded data from file 1 into file 2</li>
                <li>m extract alien message from file 1 and place in file 2 using u and v</li>
              </ul>
           
              The file encryption and decryption is designed and implemented to work by using a hadamard matrix and replacing each bytes value with a corresponding entry in that matrix. In order to detect corruption the values are compared and if the <i>ith</i> value is found to be the best match, the bytes value is <i>i</i>. <br><br>
              The packing options cuts the size to 7/8th of the original size via the use of bit shifts and by removing padded zeroes. This is then reversed if the unpacking option has been chosen, by using an reverse method of bit shifts and padding. <br><br> 
              If option m is chosen, a special 32 character long "alien" aphabet is used, in conjunction with a different encryption process using a 64bit value. This process involves detecting and finding corrupted bits in the value, and splitting the 64 bit value into two 32 bit halfs, starting from the left (for both sections) the corrupted bits <i>ith</i> location corresponds to the alphabet lettering positions (eg. <i>ith</i> = 4, would be H). This is to be used with .txt files.<br><br>

For each type of hand a different algorithm has been established in order to determined which player has the best hand of that type. Once hand types and values have been determined, the application then ranks them in the correct order, determined by the rules of the game. <br><br>

              <b>Project Description: </b>Build and design an Ngram search application, which accesses an online Ngram database.<br>
              <b>Code Description: </b>For this project I worked primarily in the GUI development for this application.The application works via the user submitting a search query in the correct fields, in order to query an online database. A maximum of five search queries can be processed at anytime, though with a limit of five words per query. The return results (the top five) of these queries are processed, and displayed in two different ways. The first in a textual space, with the top five results and thier probability for each query listed below the initial corresponding query. A second display which the user can switch to is graphical display, shown as a bar chart, where each query and its results are given a color and plotted with phrase agaist probability. This can be seen in the imagery provided below.  <br><br>

              <b>Project Description: </b>Design and implement an application that simulates a business's warehouse.<br>
              <b>Code Description: </b>My role was to write the functionality to work with an existing GUI. This application is designed to simulate the day to day running's of a business operating out of a warehouse. The overall goal of this simulation is to not run out of stock or money over the duration of the simulation. The program is designed to randomly sell select amounts of inventory everyday to "buyers", and it is up to the user to make smart decisions in order to buy more stock or leave stock as it is. At all times the warehouse information can be view via the GUI, and the "daily" decisions can be made via the GUI controls. <br><br>
